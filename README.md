#  Image to Text Extraction Program with GUI


The Image to Text Extraction Program is a Python application that allows users to extract text from images using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance usability and simplify the process of converting images to editable text. By leveraging the capabilities of popular Python libraries, such as Tesseract and OpenCV, the program enables users to extract text from various types of images and documents.

Key Features of the Image to Text Extraction Program:

- Image Processing: The application utilizes OpenCV to preprocess the input image, applying techniques such as noise removal, resizing, and binarization to enhance the quality of the text regions. These preprocessing steps help improve the accuracy of the OCR process.

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): The program integrates Tesseract, a powerful OCR engine, to perform the actual text extraction from the preprocessed image. Tesseract supports multiple languages and can handle a wide range of fonts and text layouts.

- GUI Interface: The graphical user interface provides a user-friendly experience, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the program. Users can select an image file using a file picker, and the program automatically processes the image and extracts the text.

- Output Options: The program offers various output options to accommodate different use cases. Users can choose to display the extracted text directly on the GUI, save it as a text file, or copy it to the clipboard for further use.

- Error Handling: The application incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues, such as unsupported file formats, image processing errors, or OCR failures. Informative error messages are displayed to guide users and ensure a smooth experience.

The Image to Text Extraction Program aims to simplify the task of extracting text from images, enabling users to digitize printed or handwritten documents quickly. It can be useful in scenarios such as converting scanned documents to editable text, extracting text from images for translation, or processing text-based images for data analysis.
